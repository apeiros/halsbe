DESCRIPTION

Provides methods to register file- or application-based callbacks.

Queries:
	'version'
		The halsbe version

Methods:
	'main:(*args)'
		A block passed to on_main is executed if the file containing
		it is the script that is run (and not e.g. an imported file).

	'import:(file, *args)'
		A block passed to on_import is executed if the file is imported
		by another file.
		The callback is executed in the context of imported file, not of
		the importing file.
