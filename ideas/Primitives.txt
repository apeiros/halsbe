	Primitives are keywords that provide pseudo-methods. They are used to bootstrap

	memory:   manage the memory fragment allocated for an individual object.

	old:      in postconditions the object as it was before the method invocation
	returned: in postconditions the returnvalue
	vm:     Bootstrap Object implementation in halsbe
	object:
		-memory fragment
		-method lookup table
		-
	block:
		-argument names
		-argument defaults
		-arity
		-local variable namelist
		-local variable reference list
		-self
		-owner
		-caller
