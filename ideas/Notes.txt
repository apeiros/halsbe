Object:
	Flagbits:
		-read lock
		-write lock
		-singleton methods
		-garbage collect
		-frozen
		-tainted
Parallelism:
	Locking bits, separate read/write locks
Return values:
	Defaults to owner
	Can use returns: value to set the default return value
	Use return value to immediatly return with value
	Maybe let queries implicitly return last value (returning self makes little sense)
Metadata, import:
	Parallely import/parse, on unknown constants stop and register
Query:
	Automatically make them futures locking all state they access
