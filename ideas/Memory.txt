MEMORY
	* Memory is organized in fragments
	* A fragment is a continouos bit of memory
	* Fragments can grow or shrink (unless their grow mode is fixed)
	* Fragments can have one of four grow modes:
		* Fixed: never grows or shrinks
		* Grows: grows/shrinks in one direction (always at the end)
		* Both:  grows/shrinks in both directions
		* Unknown: the behaviour of the fragment is unknown (will usually set it to both)
		These modes help in the allocation process to find a suitable fragment
	* Every object has its own memory fragment
	* An object may only ever write to its own fragment
