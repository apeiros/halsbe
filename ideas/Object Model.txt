Method dispatch:
	object.foo
		-> check objects eigenmethods
		-> check objects templates templatemethods
		-> check whether object has method_missing in eigenmethods
		-> check whether objects template has method_missing in templatemethods
		-> raise NoMethodError

Instanciation:
	object: Template.new
		-> allocate memory
		-> set template
		-> call initialize from templates templatemethods
		-> call initialize from each mixins templatemethods
		-> return object

Mixing:
	Add a module to an object for template methods
	object.mixin Module
		-> add Module to the templatemixins List (replace technically)
		-> merge the modules templatemethods into templatemethods with
		-> callback to the module (Module.mixed)
		-> return object



Object
	* is a container for modules (mixins & conditionals)
	* has a prototype
	* has instance variables
	* has a memory fragment
	* can be frozen
	* can be copied
	* can delegate
	* has a serialization

Block
	* is a piece of code
	* can be called/run with arguments
	* has a determined set of local variables
	* has a determined set of bound variables
	* has a serialization (bytecode)

Method
	* has a body which is a block
	* has preconditions
	* has postconditions
	* has a self
	* has an owner
	* has a caller
	* takes the same arguments as the body-block

Module
	* is an object
	* has a method lookup table

Class
	* is a module
	* is a container for modules
	* is mixed into objects to provide delegation to a unified method lookup table for "instances"
	  of the class
